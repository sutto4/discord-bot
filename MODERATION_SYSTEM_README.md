### Command Options

- `delete_days`: Days of messages to delete (0-7) - optional
- `reason`: Reason for ban - optional

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The system uses three main tables:

### `moderation_cases`
Stores all moderation actions with case details.

### `moderation_evidence`
Links evidence (images, files, text) to cases.

### `moderation_logs`
Audit trail of all moderation-related actions.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   BOT_DB_HOST=your_db_host
   BOT_DB_USER=your_db_user
   BOT_DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   BOT_DB_NAME=your_db_name
   TOKEN=your_bot_token
   CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id
   ```

2. Ensure the `moderation` feature is enabled in your database:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO guild_features (guild_id, feature_key, enabled) 
   VALUES ('your_guild_id', 'moderation', 1);
   ```

### 📝 Setting Up Logging

#### Discord Channel Logging (Base Feature)
1. **Set Moderation Log Channel** (Recommended):
   ```
   /setmodlog #moderation-logs
   ```
   This sets a dedicated channel for moderation actions.

2. **Set General Log Channel** (Alternative):
   ```
   /setverifylog #general-logs
   ```
   This sets a channel for verification and moderation logs.

3. **Check Status**:
   ```
   /moderation status
   ```
   Shows current log channel configuration.

#### Priority System
- **Moderation Log Channel** (set with `/setmodlog`) - Takes priority for moderation actions
- **General Log Channel** (set with `/setverifylog`) - Fallback if no moderation log channel is set
- If neither is set, no logging occurs

### Deploy Commands

#### Feature-Aware Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
node deploy-moderation-commands.js
```
Only deploys to servers with the `moderation` feature enabled.

#### Deploy to All Servers
```bash
node deploy-moderation-commands.js --all
```

#### Preview Deployment
```bash
node deploy-moderation-commands.js --dry-run
```
